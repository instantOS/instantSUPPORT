# instantSUPPORT
a quick way to provide remote access support for instantOS

Quickly run it on any live system

```sh
bash <(curl -Ls git.io/instantsupport) 1234
```

replace 1234 with any 4-digit ping you want. It is what is used to authenticate the person giving support. 
Omitting it will default to 8080
